# Tableau-Projects
Consists Rainfall Prediction With SAS Miner and Machine Learning project visualizations.
Weather analysis can be done using machine learning. For instance, based on previous weather data, machine learning models can be used to forecast the likelihood of rain or snow in a specific area. Additionally, patterns in meteorological data, such as changes in temperature or the beginning of rain, can be found using machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms can be applied to the analysis of satellite data to spot environmental changes like shifts in vegetation or land cover.

The research objectives are explain below 
The data will be imported in SAS and classification models such as decision tree will be applied to predict rainfall in Australia 
The visualisations of the variables will be performed using Tableau and findings will be interpreted that are valuable for prediction 
Data exploration will be carried out to look into the most important variables used for prediction of rainfall
